So guys! The stream is finished! 
I have assignments for those who wanted to experiment with code))
This is for those who viewed Laravel + Angular4 stream series on my channel!

* Create admin panel!
    * Create Rights & Privileges! I've done something similar in djinni.co clone "skillhire" on my channel.
    * Users management from admin panel! Add, delete, ban, edit.
    * Logs output from admin panel! You can use "arcanedev/log-viewer" package for that. 
    * Work with filesystem.
        * Upload photos for posts!
          You can use "plank/laravel-mediable" package.
        * Write client for filesystem for admin panel!
    * System commands through routes! For example dump database or make reset)) Or one button click go to maintenance mode. and etc.
    * Posts management in admin panel! Posts pre moderation!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help
